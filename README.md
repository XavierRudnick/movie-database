1. Which hash collision was used

I used chaining because that feels like a cleaner and more efficient code. Open sourcing seems too messy which is 
why i decided to use chianing

2. explain the hash function

I used the ascii letter value sum to come up with a key based on the title, then I randomly generated a number and multiplied it by my identity key, then multiplied that by my ascii title value. This resulted in 350 collisions for the main file.

3. Did you use skip list

Yes I used skip lists.

4. anything else?

Nope.
